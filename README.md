# Car-Rental-System
The proposed project, Car Rental System, is designed and implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The system automates the core operations of a car rental service, such as managing cars, registering customers, and handling the renting and returning of cars.
Car Rental System – Java OOP with Swing GUI

This project is a simple Car Rental System built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java along with a Swing-based Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It allows users to view available cars, rent a car, and return a rented car. Each car is uniquely identified using a Car ID, making the rental and return process easy and efficient.

🚗 Features
✅ 1. View Cars

The GUI displays the list of all cars.

Shows each car’s ID, model, status (Available / Rented).

✅ 2. Rent-a-Car

Users click the “Rent a Car” button.

System asks for:

Car ID

Customer Name

Number of rental days

Calculates the total rent amount.

Marks the car as Rented.

✅ 3. Return-a-Car

Users click the “Return Car” button.

Enter the Car ID of the car they rented.

System updates the car’s status back to Available.

✅ 4. Unique Car IDs

Every car has a unique ID.

Ensures accurate and error-free rental/return operations.

✅ 5. Simple & Clean Swing GUI

Easy navigation

Buttons for quick actions

Dialog boxes for inputs and notifications
